Hosting your FastAPI + Gradio app for free (public but private-to-you)

This guide shows two free ways to host the project online so you can access the Gradio UI from any device, privately.

Options covered:
- Fly.io (free tier credit): container-based deploy with a stable public URL
- Replit (free plan): quick online hosting without containers (may require small adjustments)

Important: for true privacy, set Gradio auth env vars and/or use platform secrets / access controls. Do NOT publish hard-coded API keys.

Quick prerequisites (local):
- Docker installed (for building image locally)
- git repo with this project

1) Fly.io (recommended free route)
- Sign up at https://fly.io and install flyctl.
- Authenticate:
  flyctl auth login

- Initialize your fly app inside the repo (choose an app name):
  flyctl launch --name my-chat-app --no-deploy

- Build and deploy using Dockerfile included in this repo:
  flyctl deploy

- Set secrets (Mistral/Face++ keys, etc):
  flyctl secrets set MISTRAL_API_KEY="<your_key>" FACEPP_API_KEY="<key>" FACEPP_API_SECRET="<secret>" IMAGEROUTER_API_KEY="<key>" GRADIO_AUTH_USER="you" GRADIO_AUTH_PASS="strongpass"

- After deploy, your app will be available at https://<appname>.fly.dev

Notes:
- Fly gives a small free allocation sufficient for personal use; if you need more uptime check Fly's free tier limits.
- App logs: flyctl logs

2) Replit (no-container quick deploy)
- Create a new Replit project and import your GitHub repo or push files manually.
- Add the secrets in Replit's Secrets tab.
- In Replit, set the run command to: python chat10fixed6.py
- Replit will expose a public URL under replit domains. Use Gradio auth to restrict access.

Notes on privacy and persistence
- Both approaches host your app publicly; add Gradio auth and platform secrets to restrict access to only you.
- If you plan to store images long-term, consider uploading them to S3/GCS; container local storage may be ephemeral.

If you want, I can: 
- Add a small example `fly.toml` and help you run `flyctl launch` and `flyctl deploy`.
- Or implement an alternative deploy (Render or Hugging Face) â€” tell me which and I'll add provider-specific instructions.
